# Xperia E1 (falconss/shuang) debloater for Stock ROM
# Version 4 (2016.05.03)
Debloater script for Xperia E1 (all variants) running on Stock ROM

Uploaded it just for the sake of viewing the script without having to download the .zip

This script's purpose is to make the ROM lighter as the kernel already sucks thanks to Sony not being able to optimize it properly.
Although it really gives boost to the performance, but because of the Sony problem the phone will still lag regardless of what will you remove within the ROM.

I suggest any stranger who wanders here with Xperia E1 phone to download Caio's latest available kernel from XDA as it is 1000% much better than the crappy Stock kernel.
